## Video Streaming Service Setup and Configuration Guide

### Overview
This guide provides detailed steps on how to set up a video streaming service using AWS S3 for video storage, AWS CloudFront for content delivery, and React for the front-end user interface.

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- Node.js and npm installed
- Basic knowledge of React

### Step 1: Setting Up AWS S3
1. Log into your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the S3 service and create a new bucket.
   - Ensure that the bucket is set to public access if necessary.
3. Upload your initial video files to the S3 bucket.

### Step 2: Configuring AWS CloudFront
1. Create a new CloudFront distribution.
2. Set the origin to the S3 bucket you created earlier.
3. Configure the Origin Access Identity (OAI) to restrict direct access to the S3 bucket.
4. Update the S3 bucket policy to grant access to the CloudFront OAI.
5. Note the CloudFront distribution domain name for later use.

### Step 3: Building the Front-End with React
1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the following commands to create a new React application:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app video-streaming-service
   cd video-streaming-service
   ```
3. Update the `App.js` file to include a header:
   ```jsx
   <h2>Welcome to My Awesome Video Streaming Site</h2>
   ```
4. Style the application by modifying the `App.css` file:
   - Add text alignment, video width, height, and controls (fullscreen, volume, download, playback speed, picture-in-picture, and play/pause).

### Step 4: Integrating the Front-End with CloudFront
1. In your React application, use the CloudFront domain name to construct URLs to the videos stored in your S3 bucket.
2. Implement video playback functionality in your React components.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you will have a fully functional video streaming service that utilizes AWS for backend storage and delivery, and React for the front-end interface.
